When loading a file that has been run before (or came from a wheel, more on that later), it only loads the bytecode if the source hasn't changed - the source is not re-parsed. So inspect works by looking up the original file location. _But you can delete the original file and run from bytecode only!_ Don't do that, but you can. Also, you can run from a zip file, and the original file might not be openable. And, finally, when running live in a REPL, there may not be a source (it works in IPython for us, though).\n"

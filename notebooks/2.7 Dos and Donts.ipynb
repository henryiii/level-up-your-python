    "But this is _bad_, don't do it. For one, this breaks the flow of the function and adds unneccisary nesting. When reading a function definition, you should see code, not more function definitions. More importantly, it breaks encapuslation; a function in a function _can_ capture the outer function's scope. When you place a function within a function, the reader has to go through it, line by line, and see what variables are captured, if any. And Python’s scoping rules are evil - even the author of Python finds them hard sometimes [(see his recent tweet)](https://twitter.com/gvanrossum/status/1354305179244392453?s=20) (classes in functions or classes are _really_ bad due to some weird scoping rules for classes - hoping I don't need to tell you that!).\n",

    "There is one valid place to do a function in a function - that's for wrappers, specifically decorators. But that is the _point_ of the outer function; it's not doing anything else but wrapping an inner function. And, in general, they are often more readable as classes with a `__call__` anyway, so you might not even want the function-in-function form even in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are _very_ rare cases where you might want to define a function inside a function if you specifically _have_ to capture a variable - but you never _really_ have to capture a variable - use `functools.partial` instead if you have an API that takes a function and you need to provide the right signature. \n",

    "A one line \"named lambda\" function _might_ be an exception - but I think it’s still clearer to make it a helper. Use underscore names if you want to indicate that it’s not for external use. This is Python specific - C++ lambdas have an explicit capture specification that is a lot better.\n",

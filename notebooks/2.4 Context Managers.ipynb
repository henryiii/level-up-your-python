    "Yes! Our journey is complete, we are where I wanted to be. Context managers are one of my favorites, and a little underused, especially in user code, when they are really easy to both write and use (while decorators, for comparison, are really easy to use but a bit tricky to write). A context manager has a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager is used for what I call \"action at a distance\". It lets you schedule an action for later that is sure to always happen (unless you get a segfault, or exit a really nasty way). This is likely the most famous context manager:\n",

    "When you enter the with block, `__enter__` is called and the result is assigned to the `as` target, if there is one. Then when you leave the block, `__exit__` is called. If you leave via an exception, `__exit__` gets special arguments that let you even decide what to do based on that the exception is - or even handle the exception and continue. `contextlib` has several simple context managers, like `redirect_stdout`, `redirect_stderr`, and `suppress`:"

    "**Just a quick word on this**: if you are coming from a language like JavaScript or Ruby, you might be thinking these look like blocks/Procs/lambdas. They are not; they are unscoped, and you cannot access the code inside the with block from the context manager (unlike a decorator, too). So you cannot create a \"run this twice\" context manager, for example. They are only for action-at-a-distance."

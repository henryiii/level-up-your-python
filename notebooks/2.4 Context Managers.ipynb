    "Yes! Our journey is complete, we are where I wanted to be. Context managers are one of my favorites, and a little underused, especially in user code, when they are really easy to both write and use (while decorators, for comparison, are really easy to use but a bit tricky to write). A context manager has a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager is used for what I call \"action at a distance\". It lets you schedule an action for later that is sure to always happen (unless you get a segfault, or exit a really nasty way). This is likely the most famous context manager:\n",

    "When you enter the with block, `__enter__` is called and the result is assigned to the `as` target, if there is one. Then when you leave the block, `__exit__` is called. If you leave via an exception, `__exit__` gets special arguments that let you even decide what to do based on that the exception is - or even handle the exception and continue. `contextlib` has several simple context managers, like `redirect_stdout`, `redirect_stderr`, and `suppress`:"

    "**Just a quick word on this**: if you are coming from a language like JavaScript or Ruby, you might be thinking these look like blocks/Procs/lambdas. They are not; they are unscoped, and you cannot access the code inside the with block from the context manager (unlike a decorator, too). So you cannot create a \"run this twice\" context manager, for example. They are only for action-at-a-distance."

    "## Quick note: Async\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything we've been doing has built on itself, and we seemed to be going somewhere; the pinnacle of this direction was actually not context managers, but `async/await`. All of this feeds into `async/await`, which was formally introduced as a language component in Python 3.6. However, we did skip two necessary steps; we didn't talk about generators (iterators can actually \"send\" values in, not just produce them, but there's no specific construct for doing that, like there is for consuming values in a for loop), and we didn't talk about `yield from`, which lets you put an iterator or generator inside another one. The main reason we didn't try to reach `async` though is that I've never found a great use for it in scientific programming; it is much more intrusive than normal threading, it doesn't really \"live\" side-by-side with normal synchronous programming all that well (it's better now, though), and the libraries for it are a little young. Feel free to investigate on your own, though! I've also discussed the mechanisms behind it in detail in my blog a few years ago."

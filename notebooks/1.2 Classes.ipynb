    "All objects are \"based\" on a class (AKA type). You can call `type(object)` or `object.__class__` to get the class of an object. Types can \"inherit\" from other types, which just means they build on the other. The type is generally the \"shared\" part for objects, while the object itself holds the \"unique\" part that makes an instance special. Types tend to have methods, and instances tend to have member data, but since everything is an object, and functions really are just callable objects, the distinction between a variable and a function is a bit fuzzy. And that's okay.\n",

    "* `._some_item`: This is a \"hidden\" method - by social construct, users should not touch this, it's expected to be internal or \"protected\". Tab completion will usually ignore things that start with an `_`, unless you add the underscore then press tab. A subclass can access this.\n",
    "* `.__some_item`: This is only (easily) accessible from _inside the current class_. Outside the class, including in a subclass, it's \"mangled\" by adding the class name. This is not intended to be \"more secure\" than a hidden method, but is intended for the special case where a class and a subclass need to define the same thing but have it different between them. Very rarely used.\n",
    "* `.__some_item__`: This is a \"dunder\" attribute, and Python has many of them - they have special meaning to Python. It is not officially a good idea to add your own, as Python reserves them for future use, though some libraries (especially popular libraries) do add custom ones.\n",
    "* Extra: `._some_item_`: If you need a \"protocol\", that is, a method that users should implement but should not directly call, then single underscores on both sides is an occasional convention that is not discouraged by Python authors, unlike adding new dunder methods. `_repr_html_` in IPython is an example of this convention in use."

A vector, a URL, a remote data source, etc. You might have a class representing a unit of an analysis, and use either inheritance (okay) or a protocol (better, reduces coupling) to have real data processing vs. simulation generation.

    "We will mention testing later, and there is another course on it, but I'm focusing on the word _unit_. You need to be able to run your classes standalone, in unit tests, and not only in place. This keeps the design modular - you will resist the desire to make a class that needs a class to make another class inside a class that only works with the file that sits on your work laptop, etc. And you'll be free to redesign parts without having to worry about everything breaking down.\n",

    "\n",
    "* It is often in direct contrast with modular design (you are linking things via inheritance) and hard to truly unit test (one class might not be testable without the other).\n",
    "* It makes it harder to reason about where a method comes from when reading and debugging. Is it this class? A parent?\n",

    "However, it is also _very_ useful. Read [this article](https://hynek.me/articles/python-subclassing-redux/) (which might be a little overly-harsh on subclassing, but it has good points) and ask yourself: Do you _need_ inheritance? Would composition or a Protocol work better? Certainly, many times, it is fine, but don't let the other considerations get swept aside if you use it."

    "### Functional design tips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes with multiple states are bad**: If you have classes that init, then call some function like `.initialize()` or `.read_data()`, this is bad design. It's better to do the read in the `__init__` or as a `classmethod`. If you have two distinct states, then you have to design every method to be aware of both possible states! It's much better to either do the init at the beginning, or have two classes, one for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never assign new members outside of __init__**: This is similar to the above point; if you assign a new member after init, then you now have two states; a \"without\" and a \"with\", so now you have to check `hasattr` in every other method, since you can't be sure what order the methods will be called in. Better to at least assign None in `__init__`. Or use `dataclasses`/`attrs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider full functional design**: Python is object oriented, but it does support functional design, and it's worth thinking about it. Functional design has functions that are stateless (no mutable state), so you can chain them. So instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = Thing()\n",
    "a.init()\n",
    "a.cleanup()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You would use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = Thing().init().cleanup()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The only reason the first example could be better is due to memory usage/copying, which usually isn't a problem in Python. If it's an error to call `cleanup()` before `init()`, you can enforce that statically via classes in the second example, while the first example will just crash at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support static design wherever possible**: We will cover this later, but if you add things that are not statically sound, you probably should redesign. Simply supporting static typing tends to push you toward better design, and away from problems like those listed above.\n"

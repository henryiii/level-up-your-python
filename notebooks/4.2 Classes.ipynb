You can customize this by setting a different metaclass (usually subclasses of `type`!). And, most importantly, subclasses inherit metaclasses too, so users are not exposed to metaclasses. This is how `abc.ABC` works - it's really just a simple do-nothing class with `abc.ABCMeta` as the metaclass - and abstract base classes are implemented through a metaclass. The metaclass will check and make sure there are no remaining abstract methods when you are creating an instance of the class.\n",

The `__module__` and the `__qualname__` were sef for free for us, otherwise, it's just the things we defined inside the class body.

    "**Classes with multiple states are bad**: If you have classes that init, then call some function like `.initialize()` or `.read_data()`, this is bad design. It's better to do the read in the `__init__` or as a `classmethod`. If you have two distinct states, then you have to design every method to be aware of both possible states! It's much better to either do the init at the beginning, or have two classes, one for each state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Never assign new members outside of __init__**: This is similar to the above point; if you assign a new member after init, then you now have two states; a \"without\" and a \"with\", so now you have to check `hasattr` in every other method, since you can't be sure what order the methods will be called in. Better to at least assign None in `__init__`. Or use `dataclasses`/`attrs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consider full functional design**: Python is object oriented, but it does support functional design, and it's worth thinking about it. Functional design has functions that are stateless (no mutable state), so you can chain them. So instead of:\n",

    "The only reason the first example could be better is due to memory usage/copying, which usually isn't a problem in Python. If it's an error to call `cleanup()` before `init()`, you can enforce that statically via classes in the second example, while the first example will just crash at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support static design wherever possible**: We will cover this later, but if you add things that are not statically sound, you probably should redesign. Simply supporting static typing tends to push you toward better design, and away from problems like those listed above."

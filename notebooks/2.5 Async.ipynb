    "# Async\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything we've been doing has built on itself, and we seemed to be going somewhere; the pinnacle of this direction was actually not context managers, but `async`/`await`. All of this feeds into `async`/`await`, which was formally introduced as a language component in Python 3.6. However, we did skip a necessary step; we didn't talk about generators (iterators can actually \"send\" values in, not just produce them, but there's no specific construct for doing that, like there is for consuming values in a for loop). The main reason we didn't try to reach `async` though is that I've never found a great use for it in scientific programming; it is much more intrusive than normal threading, it doesn't really \"live\" side-by-side with normal synchronous programming all that well (it's better now, though), and the libraries for it are a little young. Feel free to investigate on your own, though! I've also discussed the mechanisms behind it in detail in my blog a few years ago."

    "The reason this is \"better\" than threaded programming might not be obvious, but it's this: code you write runs in the order you see. Most of the challenges of threaded programming, like mutexes and locks, simply aren't an issue with async programming, because it's not running in threads. You can still delegate work to threads, but keep the outer logic in sequence.\n",

    "    do_a()\n",
    "    do_b() # This will always run right after do_a, nothing will run in between\n",
    "    await do_c() # Execution pauses here, and other coroutines might start and run till their awaits\n",
